# PolII_DSIF
## Investigation of Pol II - DSIF Elongation Complex Dynamics using MD Simulations
This repository contains scripts for the analysis of simulations of the RNA polymerase (Pol II) elongation complexes with and without DSIF elongation factor. It also contains the output data obtained from the analyses.

*** Requirements:
```
Python versions 3+

MDAnalysis
```
*** Usage:
```
python [options] filename.py
```
*** Example:

To calculate RMSD of biomolecules (proteins or nucleic acids):
```
python rmsd_mda.py
```
